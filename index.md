## Welcome to the Sandbox

This page is a sandbox for playing with Markdown and Github pages using the basic Jekyll themes.


**AUDIO**

We can simply use HTML tages to add an audio player for the mp3 in the repository. 
```
<audio controls="controls" src="https://sitaber.github.io/sandbox/000002.mp3"> 
    Your browser does not support the HTML5 Audio element.
    </audio>
```
And we get...

1. <audio controls="controls" src="https://sitaber.github.io/sandbox/000002.mp3"> Your browser does not support the HTML5 Audio element. </audio>

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sitaber/sandbox/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

And we can [add remote themes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll) and find help with other aspects
